I have not been a voracious reader, but few books have caught my attention or been recomended by sommeone over time. I list such book in this page and mention my opinion on them as well. 

* God Created the Integers, *Stephen Hawking* - Provider a uniform overview of the history of Mathematics and variour areas of their work. (3.5/5) 
* Men Of Mathematics, *E T Bel* - Great book! Enough said. (5/5)
* Catcher in the Rye, *Jerome David Salinger* - Marvelous book! Quite simply captures what it is like to be a teenager. (5/5)
