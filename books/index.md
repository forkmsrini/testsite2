I have not been a voracious reader, but few books have caught my attention or been recomended by sommeone over time. I list such book in this page and mention my opinion on them as well. 

* God Created the Integers, *Stephen Hawking* - Provider a uniform overview of the history of Mathematics and variour areas of their work. (3.5/5) 

* Men Of Mathematics, *E T Bel* - Great book! Enough said. (5/5)

* Catcher in the Rye, *Jerome David Salinger* - Marvelous book! Quite simply captures what it is like to be a teenager. (5/5)

* The Mythical Man-Month, *Fred Brooks* - You are not alone in encountering problems during development. On a certain level, these may even be predicted. The first iteration may be redundunt as we learn to build only then. (4/5) 

* The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master, *Andrew Hunt & David Thomas* - Write comments. Code clean. 'Keep knowledge in plain text,' a quote from the book. (4/5) 
* Code Complete, *Steve McConnell* - 'Do not use booleans as status variables.' A good primer. (3.5/5)


This list shall be updated from time to time when I have time...
