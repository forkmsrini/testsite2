OneLiner Introduction: Average Joe with interest in artificial intelligence.

### Work

### Research Interest

I'm particularly interested **Machine Learning** with appplication in Computer Vision and Game theory (yet to explore). Theoretical aspects of Statistics like probability modelling intrigue me.
