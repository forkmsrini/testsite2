### Research Interest

I'm inquisitive about the working of our brain and would like to build applications using artificial inetelligence that mimic the nous. I'm particularly interested **Machine Learning** with appplication in Computer Vision and Game theory (yet to explore). Theoretical aspects of Statistics like probability modelling intrigue me.
