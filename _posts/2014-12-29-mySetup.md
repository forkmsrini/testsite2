title: My Setup
---

In this post I describe my setup and routines that I follow for programming. 

### The Hardware
I use an early 2013 MacBook Pro with a 2.6 GHz Intel Core i7 processor, 8 gigs of RAM and 500 GB HDD. This is the best piece of hardware that I have owned thus far and enjoy juicing it. Even though the 15-inch MBP is a bit bulky, I carry it around with me, always. This serves me well as my PC and work machine. 
In addition to this, I use a Logitech Performance MX mouse. Again, this is the best mouse I have experience and shall probably never go back to using Apple’s Magic Mouse/Track pad. I also carry few connectors for the laptop, as these are not commonly available around here. My go to earphone are the Audio Technica ATH-M50 and Sony MDR-XB30EX in-ear phones.  

### The Software
Since I haven’t identified my go to ''language,” I have a lot of choices and IDEs to work with. First off, [MATLAB](http://in.mathworks.com/products/matlab/) is golden and I have been using it since my undergrad days. Then, I use [Eclipse IDE](https://eclipse.org/downloads/) for many of the Java programs. [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) is the text editor that I feel most comfortable to use (because of the customizations and themes mainly). [Enthought Canopy](https://store.enthought.com/) (free edition) is the Python editor in addition to the terminal (an alternate would be iTerm2). The list of other programs installed is: [R](http://www.r-project.org/), [Weka](http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/downloading.html), [Torch 7](https://github.com/torch/torch7), [Julia](http://julialang.org/downloads/), [Knime](https://www.knime.org/downloads/knime/macosx) and many more. I have this clutter, as there is a demand to program in multiple languages across various platforms at which I hope to become good at!

For versions control I use [Transmit](http://panic.com/transmit/) or GitHub. I use texmaker Latex editor to prepare formal documents like papers, reports etc. A trivial, yet very useful software is Caffeine to keep my screen awake while I read papers at length. I use [VMware Fusion](http://www.vmware.com/in/products/fusion) to run a flavor of Window on my Mac. Beside these, I have Microsoft Office Suite, Photoshop and TeamViewer installed. Google Chrome best fits my needs as I can share history and bookmarks across devices and I rarely close tabs. 

Many of the software that I use are openly available or at least available for free for personal use. I also intentionally try to build all my sites using the Git (saves me the trouble of managing Ruby versions and setting up a MAMP server, but this requires an active internet connection of course).

I would love to hear about the setup and software consumption of others and try to improve on my existing environment.

PS: I would have missed out some IDE that I use regularly as the post would then become long and stodgy.
