title: Mannargudi - My Home Town
---

Gopalasamudram, [Mannargudi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mannargudi) is where my elders and ancestors lived. My great grandfather Sri. U. Ve. Mannargudi Gopalan Iynegar was a pacticing doctor at Gopalasamudram and later on moved to then Madras.

Mannargudi is famous for the [Sri Vidhya Rajagopalaswamy Temple](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajagopalaswamy_Temple,_Mannargudi). The temple's architecture is very beautiful alike all temples. The compound wall is about 8m tall and is a fanstastic sight (*Mannargudi Mathil Azhagu*). The temple's tank called the *Haridranadhi* is once among the biggest in India. [Vaduvur Sri Kothandaramaswamy Temple](https://sites.google.com/site/vaduvur/) is near by. 


I wish to go back some day, and settle here for good.
