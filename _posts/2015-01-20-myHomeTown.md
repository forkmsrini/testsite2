Gopalasamudram, [Mannargudi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mannargudi) is where my elders and ancestors lived. My great grandfather Sri. U. Ve. Gopalan Iynegar was a pacticing doctor at Gopalasamudram. It is beleived that my ancestors were decendents of a famour scholar Periyavachan Pillai (periyavAchAn piLLai) who has written vyAkyAnams (translates to commentries) for about 400 pAsurams for periyAzhwAr thirumozhi. 

Mannargudi is famous for the Sri Vidhya Rajagopalaswamy temple. The temple's architecture is very beautiful alike all temples. The compound wall is about 8m tall and is a fanstastic sight (##Mannargudi Mathil Azhagu##).
